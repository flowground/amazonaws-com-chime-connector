    "description": "The Amazon Chime API (application programming interface) is designed for\nadministrators to use to perform key tasks, such as creating and managing Amazon\nChime accounts and users. This guide provides detailed information about the\nAmazon Chime API, including operations, types, inputs and outputs, and error\ncodes.\n\nYou can use an AWS SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the REST\nAPI to make API calls. We recommend using an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI. Each API\noperation includes links to information about using it with a language-specific\nAWS SDK or the AWS CLI.\n\nUsing an AWS SDK You don't need to write code to calculate a signature for\nrequest authentication. The SDK clients authenticate your requests by using\naccess keys that you provide. For more information about AWS SDKs, see the AWS\nDeveloper Center [http://aws.amazon.com/developer/].\n\nUsing the AWS CLI Use your access keys with the AWS CLI to make API calls. For\ninformation about setting up the AWS CLI, see Installing the AWS Command Line\nInterface [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html] in\nthe AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. For a list of available Amazon Chime\ncommands, see the Amazon Chime commands\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/chime/index.html] in the AWS\nCLI Command Reference.\n\nUsing REST API If you use REST to make API calls, you must authenticate your\nrequest by providing a signature. Amazon Chime supports signature version 4. For\nmore information, see Signature Version 4 Signing Process\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html] in the \nAmazon Web Services General Reference.\n\nWhen making REST API calls, use the service name chime and REST endpoint \nhttps://service.chime.aws.amazon.com.\n\nAdministrative permissions are controlled using AWS Identity and Access\nManagement (IAM). For more information, see Control Access to the Amazon Chime\nConsole [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/control-access.html] in the \nAmazon Chime Administration Guide.",
